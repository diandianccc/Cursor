# User Journey Map

A React application for creating and managing user journey maps with interactive three-level hierarchy: stages, tasks, and steps with persona-based color coding. Features dual view modes for comprehensive analysis.

## Features

- **Stages**: Add horizontally-displayed stages (e.g., "Awareness", "Consideration")
- **Tasks**: Add horizontally-displayed tasks within each stage (e.g., "Research", "Compare")  
- **Steps**: Add vertically-stacked step cards under each task
- **Step Details**: Each step includes description, pain points, and opportunities
- **Personas & Color-Coding**: Assign personas to steps with visual color coding
- **Dual View Modes**: Toggle between Step View and Painpoint View for different analysis perspectives
- **Interactive UI**: Click-to-edit functionality with modals for all levels
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS

## View Modes

### Step View (Default)
- Shows individual step cards with full details
- Allows editing, adding, and deleting steps
- Traditional hierarchical view of Stage → Task → Step

### Painpoint View
- Groups all pain points and opportunities from task steps
- Displays pain points and opportunities in separate colored sections
- Shows which step and persona each point originated from
- Ideal for identifying patterns and prioritizing improvements
